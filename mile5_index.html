          <p>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Task 1</strong> - The app allows the user to enter factors like weight, age and height
                   and generates a rough estimate of what their caloric intake should be to lose weight. It will give them a rough amount of weight to lose weekly and what their 
                  caloric intakes should be to support that lose within the timeframe they want to lose it.
                  These calculations use the Harris-Benedict equation to calculate baseline caloric needs.
                </li>
                <p></p>

                <li> <strong>Task 2</strong> - The system allows the user to enter in workout routines 
                  and saves those workouts to their profile</li>
                <p></p>
                <li><strong>Task 3 (unfinished)</strong> - The system should allow the user to create workout schedules on a calendar using the 
                  workout routines they’ve created previously.</li>

              <li>
                I've never worked with a web app framework like Vue or a database management tool like Supabase. A major plus from this project
                is I feel like I can put any basic web app ideas I have to "paper" after learning
                some of the basic technologies behind web development.

            <p>Difficulties</p>

          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Learning to use git at a basic level was pretty difficult at first. I'm pretty comfortable with it now
                though and finally understand how uesful it can be.
                <p></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                I had a strange amount of trouble understanding the basic SQL I needed to know in order to write
                database policies.
                <p></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                While Vue seems fairly intuitive to me now, I'd say a good 50 percent of my time on this project was spent just thinking
                of ways to do the basic tasks this project required through Vue.
                <p></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                There are 2 strange bugs I still can't figure out. Firstly, any time the web app deployment(not localhost) reloads, the app crashes. The
                  second bug is even stranger, values for caloric restrictions and caloric deficit are flipped on deployment.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Finding a good starting point was hard given there is a lot of options for frameworks and DBs

              </li>
              <li>
                Compatibility issues -
                  We are using Vue 3.0 and many of the libraries I spend a lot of time researching and trying to implement ended up not working with 3.0.
                  So there was a lot of work/time that was thrown out because of this
